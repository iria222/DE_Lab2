# Execution instructions
1. Create a MySQL connection.
2. In MySQL Workbench open said connection and run the qualifying.sql,
pit stops.sql and results.sql files to create the databases.
3. Open the config.json file and change the database connection parame-
ters as needed. These values will later be used to establish a connection
with the databases built in the previous step. The names of each of the
databases are hardcoded in the correspondent python files.
4. Install the necessary Python libraries. The requirements.txt file in-
cludes the library details.
5. Run qualifying.py, pit stops.py and results.py.
Note: The CSV files should be located in the Data folder.
